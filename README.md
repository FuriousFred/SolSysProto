# SolSysProto
Old project, contains incomplete features but still functional. Feel free to use it however you wish.
Arrow keys to turn and move forward, F to speed up, space to shoot, R to generate more items in the system, fly into a gate (big grey circle) to randomize a new system from scratch (If you can't find it, just press J).
